    His Moola Brundavana is in Kumbakonam (Tamil Nadu).  It is said he was an expert in all 64 arts and virtually he had won over chief artists of his time in each discipline.  E.g. sculpting, singing, writing, rope walk etc.,  He is also Parama guru of Sri Manthralaya Mahan.  It is noteworthy that he had penned about 104 works on Dwaitha Sidhantha.  Following legendary incidents in his life do confirm to us the greatness of Sri Vijayeendra.

<p>
    Once in his course of Sriman Moola Rama puja, he was afflicted with fever and started shivering.  At that time he had requested the jwara devatha to get transformed into his kashaya vastra and he would take it back after the Moola rama puja.  As promised he had taken the jwara devata back to him, after Sriman Moola Rama puja and suffered the pangs of high fever.  Yet another incident of his greatness was observed by Surendra teertha of Sri Rayar mutt, a whole tulasi vana turning into nirmalya on Vishnu teertha (poorva ashrama name of Sri Vijayeendra) uttering Krishnarpanam.

<p>Even today Sri Vijayeendra alleviates the suffering of his devotee as they worship him.</p>

 <p>His aradhana day falls on Jyeshta Shudda Trayodashi.</p>
