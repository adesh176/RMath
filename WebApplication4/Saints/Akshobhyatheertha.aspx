    Among the 4 cardinal disciples of Sri Madhwacharya, he was fourth in the line.  He is also an Pre-eminent Madhwa saint.  During his time he had held discussion (debates) with Vidyaranya, the great exponent of Adwaitha of his time.  It is said that the arguments of both these were sent in a sealed cover to Sri Vedanta desigar (It is also said the whole debate took place in the presence of Vedanta desigar).  On perusal of their respective arguments of the Maha vakhya “TATVAMASI”; Vedanta desigar had declares Sri Akshobhya Tirtha as the winner of the argument.  To commemorate the victory of Sri Akshobhya Tirtha over Sri Vidyaranya, a memorial stone illar was erected on hillock opposite to Narasimha Tirtha (Mulubagulu mutt).  Even today you can see the Vijaya sthamba at that place.  Besides Sri Akshobhya Tirtha had sketched the figure had turned into idol of Sri Yoga Narasimha, which can be seen even today at Mulubagulu mutt, indicative of the greatness of Sri Akshobhya Tirtha.  Greatest contribution of Sri Akshobhya Tirtha to Madhwa sidhantha is the identification of Sri Jayatirtha, as his sishya, who has exelled in writing great commentaries on Sarva Moola granthas of Sriman Madhwacharya.  Sri Akshobhya Tirtha’s moola Brundavana is at Malkhed.  His aradhana day falls on Margaseersha Krishna panchami.
