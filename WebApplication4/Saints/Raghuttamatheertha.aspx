    His moola Brundavana is located at Manampundi on the southern bank of Pinakini.  He was ordained into saint hood at the early age of 8 by Sri Raghuvarya Theertha.  Virtually he has spent all his time in childhood time with Sri Raghuvarya and was brought up on the abhisheka milk of Sriman Moola Rama.  He was handed over to the math on the day he was born in a golden plate without coming in contact with mother earth.

    Incidentally as per the dream of Sri Raghuvarya, it is well known that Raghuthamma is the rebirth of Niruti only.  He underwent gurukula with adya Varadachari who happened to be very proud and egoistic person and did not impart veda sastras properly to Sri Raghuthamma Theertha. It has upset Raghuthama to no ends.  As an insult to the injury one day Raghuthamma was invited to dwadasi parana at Adya varadaraji’s place.  Even before Raghuthamm could reach adya varadachari’s place for his parana after his daily ablutions, adya varadachari had started eating without waiting for Sri Raghutthama.  Thus crest fallen and he was brooding over this insult.  During the early hours of the next day, God himself appeared in the dream in the form of his guru  Shri Raghuvarya Theertharu, and inscribed the “bheeja-akshara” on the tongue of Shri Raghuthamma Theertharu and thus Raghuthamma turned to be great scholar in veda sastraas over night.  He started taking classes to his disciples on his own.  During his time he saw to it that his parent mutt (Uttaradi math) reached great heights in honor, riches, rewards and recognition.  His contribution to the dwaitha sidhantha title as Bhavabodha works such as Brihadaranya Bhavabhoda, Nyaya Vivarana Bhavabhoda, Gitabhashya Bhavabhoda (Prameya Dipika Bhavabhoda), Vishnutatvanirnaya Bhavabhoda  and Tattvaprakashika Bhavabhoda.  Hence he came to know as Bhavabodaka.  As a child Raghuthamma killing the ghost needs to be elaborated.
