    <h3>Sriman Jayatheertha</h3>
</div>
<p>Sri Jayatirtha was born into small state chietain’s family in 14th century, in north Karnataka.  His poorva-ashrama name was Dhondu pant.</p>

    One day, Sri Akshobhya Tirtha was reflecting on who would be his successor, of his mutt as he was ageing, on the banks of Bheema river.  Consequently, he had a vision that a person who would drink water from river like a animal, would be his successor.  To his surprise, one day as he was meditating on the banks of the river, he saw a person on a horse back in the river, leaning and sipping the water directly.  So he was very much elated that he found his successor.  He asked the person “Kim Pashu Poorva Dehe”(where you an animal in your previous birth).  On hearing this word, person could re-collect his previous birth as bull and how he carried Sri Madhwacharya’s grantha on his back.  And how he was intently watching the discourses of Sri Madhwa to his sishyaas. Immediately he prostrated before Sri Akshobhya Tirtha and requested him to grant him sanyasa.  Sri Akshobhya Tirtha gladly granted sanyasa to him.  On hearing this,  Dhondu pant’s father got wild and sent his men to fetch his son back forcefully.  To dissuade his son from becoming a sanyasa, he had arranged the wedding night with his young wife, as his wife went to his room, she was frightened to see a hooded snake and ran away from the room.  Now father realized his folly of dissuading Dhondu pant from sanyasa.  Repenting his blunder, he took his son back to Sri Akshobhya Tirtha and asked for his pardon.  Thus Dhondu pant was introduced into sanyasa with the name of Sri Jayatirtha.

<p> Thanks to blessings and benedictions of goddess Durga and the extra ordinary coaching of Sri Akshobhya Tirtha, he could become a erudite scholar.  As he was privy to the discourses of Sri Madhwacharya (in his previous birth as a Bull), his works on Madhwa philosophy are considered to be very authentic.  He has written commentaries on 18 sarva moola grantha’s of Sri Acharya.  Though Sri Madhwa was founder of dwaitha siddanta the quintessential commentary of Sri Jayatirtha only is responsible for the propagation of dwaitha siddhantha.  Hence he was called commentator par excellence (Teekacharya) by the great learned scholars of his time.  It may not be out of place to say, without the commentaries of Sri Teekacharya (especially Sriman Nyaya Sudha) the Madhwa sidhantha would not have seen the light of the day.  Later commentators relied on Sri Teekacharya’s view point.  Thus Sri Jayaritha(Sri Teejacharya) holds an uncontested position in Madhwa sidhantha.  His moola Brundavana is located at Malkhed village about 40km from Gulbarga.  His aradhana day falls on Ashada Shukla Panchami.</p>
