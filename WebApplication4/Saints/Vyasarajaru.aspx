    After Sri Jayatirtha, Sri Vyasaraja is the great exponent in Dwaitha sidhantha.  He was born in the year 1447, into the family of old couple Balanna and Lakshmi of Kashyapa gothra, thanks to the blessings of Sri Veda Vyasa and Sri Brahmanya Tirtha.  He was introducted into saint hood in the year 1454 by Sri Brahmanya Tirtha.  Later he was sent to Sri Padaraja for further studies.  In other words, Sri Padaraja was his vidya guru.

<p>
    His works on Dwaitha sidhantha such as Tatparya Chandrika, Nyaya Mrutha, Tarka Tandava are very popular in negating the other schools of thoughts of the day.  Hence he was known as Chandrikacharya.
</p>

<p>
    Sri Vyasaraja was the raja guru of Krishna devaraya and he saved the king from imminent death due to Kuha yoga, by ascending the throne of Vijaya nagaram for that duration (Three and three-fourths ghatika).  Subsequently he was called Vyasa raja.  In fact Vyasa Raja became the raja guru of Krishna devaraya, on the recommendation of Sri Padaraja, as Sri Padaraja could not accept it due to his old age.

<p>
    One’s greatness lies in getting recognized by his adversaries.  In case of Vyasa Raja, a noted Adwaithi scholar lika Somanatha Kavi has extolled the greatness of Vyasa Raja in his work “Vyasa Yogi Charitha”.

    Sri Vyasaraja was very much fond of Mukhya prana and he was responsible for installing 732 idols of Sri Hanuman in 3 states (Tamilnadu, Andhrapradesh and Karnataka).  The distinct feature of all Hanuman idols is –with tail curved upward and bell at the end of tail.  Following incident further reinforces his fondness of Sri Anjaneya.  As he was meditating at Chakra Tirtha in Hamp he used to see a monkey appearing on a rock and later he drew a figure of monkey on the rock with a charcoal.  But that figure used to disappear everytime.  It was an enigma for him as how to retain the figure on the rock.  Consequently, he stumbled on the idea of binding
</p>

<p>
    Sri Hanuman figure with an yantra encircled by number of monkey hold each one’s tail.  Thus he ensured the retention of Sri Hanuman figure.  It is called Yantradharaka Hanuman, which was installed in a small temple on the banks of chakra teertha.  Further he is composed a sloka on Yantrodharaka Hanuman.  His sample of greatness lies in synoptic one sloka elaborating the entire Madhwa sidhantha.  “Sriman Madhwamate, Hare paratarah…”.  His Moola Brundavana is located at Navabrundavana on the island of Tungabadra near Hampi/Anegundi.  His aradhana day falls on Phalguna Krishna chathurthi
