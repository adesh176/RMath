    Sri Madhwacharya has played a vital role in the renaissance of vaidika Hindu philosophy along with 2 other Acharyas Sri Sankara and Sri Ramanuja and particularly resurrection of a pracheena Dwaitha sidhantha (dualism).  He is believed to be the avatara of Vayu.  He was born as Madhwa only to reestablish the supremacy of Dwaitha sidhantha over the extant religions of his day.  He was born on the auspicious day of Vijaya-dasami(Dussehra) into Madhyageha family due to persistence penance by his parents at Sri Anantheswara temple at Udupi.  He was named as Vasudeva by his parents and he started his gurukula under his father at pajaka shetra, a village about 18 km from Udupi, on the Udupi Mangalore road.

    During his childhood days, Vasudeva exhibited extraordinary talent for grasping all spiritual teachings.  He was drawn to the path of renunciation and even as a boy of eleven years, he was intiated into monastic order by Achyutha Prekcha Achar, a reputed ascetic of the time, near Udupi.  The preceptor Achyutha Prekcha Achar gave the boy Vasudeva the name of Sri Ananda Tirtha at the time of his initiation into sanyasa.

<p>
    As a child he had performed a lot of miracles, which foretold his future greatness.  Once he was asked to protect the curds and milk kept in the pots from cats.  Being playful and restive child, he lifted two huge pieces of granites and closed the milk and curd pots.  These mosuru kallu (curd stone) and Halu kallu (milk stone) has been preserved for the posterity, even today at Pajaka shetra.

<p>
    Madhyageha bhataa (father of Vasudeva), once took loan from a local money lender for purchasing cows.  He was not able to pay back the debts and the money lender was pressurizing him.  On knowing this Vasudeva(Madhwa) gave a handful of tamarind seeds to the money lender and said that father’s loan has been settled.  To the money lender’s surprise, the tamarind seeds given by Vasudeva was turned in gold nuggets and money lender was happy to receive the loan was paid back.

<p>
    The entire Dwaitha sidhantha that was expounded by Srimad Acharya was eloquently condensed into one sloka by Sri Vyasaraja Tirtha as below.  Sriman Madhwa mate….Hari.  Thus Srimad Acharya unequivocally said that Sri Hari is supreme, world is true, differences are real, souls are cohorts of Sri Hari, reach different ultimate states, mukti(liberation from bondage) is the experience of the joy of one’s own nature, achieved by flawless devotion and Sri Hari is praised in all the Veda.
</p>

<p>
    Srimad Acharya has authored several great works that extols Sriman Narayana’s greatness, which is known as Sarva Moola grantha, which amounts to 37 in total.  And his commentary on Brahma sutra is 22nd in line.  These are considered as embodiment of the Dwaitha sidhantha, since Acharya himself had met Sri Vedavyasa in person at upper Badari and got all these esoteric knowledge.
</p>

<p>
    Srimad Acharya is credited with the installation of Lord Sri Krishna at Udupi and ensured that the pooja is performed to this lord without any breaks by establishing 8 mutts in and around Udupi.
</p>

<p>
    During his time, the voracious Srimad Acharya won over experts of other schools of thoughts, establishing the supremacy of Dwaitha sidhantha. One such debate was with Trivikrama pundit(of Adwaitha school) that went for days and finally Srimad Acharya won it convincingly.  Later, Trivikrama pundit accepted the philosophy Srimad Acharya.  Once Srimad Acharya was performing his daily pooja, accidentally Trivikrama pundit was fortunate to see Madhwa doing pooja in three rupas, as Sri Hanuman to Sri Rama, Sri Bheema to Sri Krishna and as Sri Madhwa to VedaVyasa.  Instantaneously he composed Sri Vayu Sthuthi praising the 3 avatars of Vayudeva and subsequently Sri Acharya composed Sri Narasimha Nakha stuthi and appended it as Kavacha before and after Vayu stuthi, thereby earned the name Sri Hari Vayu Sthuthi.  It is the most precious and cherished sloka for Madhwas.
</p>

<p>
    It is said that brevity is the soul of wit and all of Srimad Acharya’s grantha aptly fitted this maxim.  Even it was very difficulty for a learned scholar to decipher his writings.  But for Sri Jayatirtha’s detailed commentary, the Dwaitha sidhantha would not have reached the zenith.
</p>

<p>
    One day when he was teaching Ithreya Upanishad to his pupils, he suddenly disappeared in a Pushpa vrishti (shower of flowers).  That day is celebrated every year as Madhwa navami during magha shukla paksha.  It is believed; even today he is staying at upper Badari and listening to Sri Vedavyasa’s teaching.
